	abstract = {support for the biomass. Considering the complexity of this type of system. previously to the startup. several experiences were performed in a series of minireactors. such as' determination of the bed expansion and the feed distribution. The startup was made mcreasing gradually the organic load rate (OLR). using the alkalinity rallo (a) and the removal of the organic load. as mgtl of COD. as leading parameters. The system 811ained a COD removal of over 85\%. for an OLR of 3.4 [kg COD/mJ·d). The best removal of92\% was obtained at an OLR of 1.04 [kg COD/mJ·d). with a hydraulic retention tIme (HRT) of 12 hours. The best gas production of 1.8 [m' of biogaslmJ·d). equivalent to a production of 0.16 [mJ/kg COD..\_). was obtained at an (HRT) of 4.8 hours. The best startup results were obtained using Ethanol as the Carbon source.},

	abstract = {The anaerobic fluidized bed biofilm reactor (AFBBR) was evaluated as a means for corn starch wastewater pretreatment. Laboratory results indicate that good chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and methane production are achievable in AFBBRs operated at proper food:microorganism (F:M) ratios. Over 70\% of feed COD can be removed and 15 L/d of methane can be produced at F:M ratios as high as 3.45 g COD/g TVS·d. Reactor biomass holdups greater than 15 000 mg/L are achievable in AFBBRs. The combined effects of biofilm detachment, biofilm growth, and intentional bioparticle wastage and biofilm separation cause finite AFBBR mean cell residence time (MCRT). A desirable MCRT is achievable in AFBBRs that will ensure good COD reduction and methane production.},
